  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provide a convenient way to create directories of
  arbitrary depth and to delete an entire directory subtree from the
  filesystem.
  
  The following functions are provided:
  
  =over
  
  =item make_path( $dir1, $dir2, .... )
  
  =item make_path( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )
  
  The C<make_path> function creates the given directories if they don't
  exists before, much like the Unix command C<mkdir -p>.
  
  The function accepts a list of directories to be created. Its
  behaviour may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as the last
  parameter on the call.
  
  The function returns the list of directories actually created during
  the call; in scalar context the number of directories created.
  
  The following keys are recognised in the option hash:
  
  =over
  
  =item mode => $num
  
  The numeric permissions mode to apply to each created directory
  (defaults to 0777), to be modified by the current C<umask>. If the
  directory already exists (and thus does not need to be created),
  the permissions will not be modified.
  
  C<mask> is recognised as an alias for this parameter.
  
  =item verbose => $bool
  
  If present, will cause C<make_path> to print the name of each directory
  as it is created. By default nothing is printed.
  
  =item error => \$err
  
  If present, it should be a reference to a scalar.
  This scalar will be made to reference an array, which will
  be used to store any errors that are encountered.  See the L</"ERROR
  HANDLING"> section for more information.
  
  If this parameter is not used, certain error conditions may raise
  a fatal error that will cause the program will halt, unless trapped
  in an C<eval> block.
  
  =item owner => $owner
  
  =item user => $owner
  
  =item uid => $owner
  
  If present, will cause any created directory to be owned by C<$owner>.
  If the value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a uid, otherwise
  as username is assumed. An error will be issued if the username cannot be
  mapped to a uid, or the uid does not exist, or the process lacks the
  privileges to change ownership.
  
  Ownwership of directories that already exist will not be changed.
  
  C<user> and C<uid> are aliases of C<owner>.
  
  =item group => $group
  
  If present, will cause any created directory to be owned by the group C<$group>.
  If the value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a gid, otherwise
  as group name is assumed. An error will be issued if the group name cannot be
  mapped to a gid, or the gid does not exist, or the process lacks the
  privileges to change group ownership.
  
  Group ownwership of directories that already exist will not be changed.
  
      make_path '/var/tmp/webcache', {owner=>'nobody', group=>'nogroup'};
  
  =back
  
  =item mkpath( $dir )
  
  =item mkpath( $dir, $verbose, $mode )
  
  =item mkpath( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $mode )
  
  =item mkpath( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )
  
  The mkpath() function provide the legacy interface of make_path() with
  a different interpretation of the arguments passed.  The behaviour and
  return value of the function is otherwise identical to make_path().
  
  =item remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, .... )
  
  =item remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )
  
  The C<remove_tree> function deletes the given directories and any
  files and subdirectories they might contain, much like the Unix
  command C<rm -r> or C<del /s> on Windows.
  
  The function accepts a list of directories to be
  removed. Its behaviour may be tuned by an optional hashref
  appearing as the last parameter on the call.
  
  The functions returns the number of files successfully deleted.
  
  The following keys are recognised in the option hash:
  
  =over
  
  =item verbose => $bool
  
  If present, will cause C<remove_tree> to print the name of each file as
  it is unlinked. By default nothing is printed.
  
  =item safe => $bool
  
  When set to a true value, will cause C<remove_tree> to skip the files
  for which the process lacks the required privileges needed to delete
  files, such as delete privileges on VMS. In other words, the code
  will make no attempt to alter file permissions. Thus, if the process
  is interrupted, no filesystem object will be left in a more
  permissive mode.
  
  =item keep_root => $bool
  
  When set to a true value, will cause all files and subdirectories
  to be removed, except the initially specified directories. This comes
  in handy when cleaning out an application's scratch directory.
  
    remove_tree( '/tmp', {keep_root => 1} );
  
  =item result => \$res
  
  If present, it should be a reference to a scalar.
  This scalar will be made to reference an array, which will
  be used to store all files and directories unlinked
  during the call. If nothing is unlinked, the array will be empty.
  
    remove_tree( '/tmp', {result => \my $list} );
    print "unlinked $_\n" for @$list;
  
  This is a useful alternative to the C<verbose> key.
  
  =item error => \$err
  
  If present, it should be a reference to a scalar.
  This scalar will be made to reference an array, which will
  be used to store any errors that are encountered.  See the L</"ERROR
  HANDLING"> section for more information.
  
  Removing things is a much more dangerous proposition than
  creating things. As such, there are certain conditions that
  C<remove_tree> may encounter that are so dangerous that the only
  sane action left is to kill the program.
  
  Use C<error> to trap all that is reasonable (problems with
  permissions and the like), and let it die if things get out
  of hand. This is the safest course of action.
  
  =back
  
  =item rmtree( $dir )
  
  =item rmtree( $dir, $verbose, $safe )
  
  =item rmtree( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $safe )
  
  =item rmtree( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )
  
  The rmtree() function provide the legacy interface of remove_tree()
  with a different interpretation of the arguments passed. The behaviour
  and return value of the function is otherwise identical to
  remove_tree().
  
  =back
  
  =head2 ERROR HANDLING
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<NOTE:>
  
  The following error handling mechanism is considered
  experimental and is subject to change pending feedback from
  users.
  
  =back
  
  If C<make_path> or C<remove_tree> encounter an error, a diagnostic
  message will be printed to C<STDERR> via C<carp> (for non-fatal
  errors), or via C<croak> (for fatal errors).
  
  If this behaviour is not desirable, the C<error> attribute may be
  used to hold a reference to a variable, which will be used to store
  the diagnostics. The variable is made a reference to an array of hash
  references.  Each hash contain a single key/value pair where the key
  is the name of the file, and the value is the error message (including
  the contents of C<$!> when appropriate).  If a general error is
  encountered the diagnostic key will be empty.
  
  An example usage looks like:
  
    remove_tree( 'foo/bar', 'bar/rat', {error => \my $err} );
    if (@$err) {
        for my $diag (@$err) {
            my ($file, $message) = %$diag;
            if ($file eq '') {
                print "general error: $message\n";
            }
            else {
                print "problem unlinking $file: $message\n";
            }
        }
    }
    else {
        print "No error encountered\n";
    }
  
  Note that if no errors are encountered, C<$err> will reference an
  empty array.  This means that C<$err> will always end up TRUE; so you
  need to test C<@$err> to determine if errors occured.
  
  =head2 NOTES
  
  C<File::Path> blindly exports C<mkpath> and C<rmtree> into the
  current namespace. These days, this is considered bad style, but
  to change it now would break too much code. Nonetheless, you are
  invited to specify what it is you are expecting to use:
  
    use File::Path 'rmtree';
  
  The routines C<make_path> and C<remove_tree> are B<not> exported
  by default. You must specify which ones you want to use.
  
    use File::Path 'remove_tree';
  
  Note that a side-effect of the above is that C<mkpath> and C<rmtree>
  are no longer exported at all. This is due to the way the C<Exporter>
  module works. If you are migrating a codebase to use the new
  interface, you will have to list everything explicitly. But that's
  just good practice anyway.
  
    use File::Path qw(remove_tree rmtree);
  
  =head3 API CHANGES
  
  The API was changed in the 2.0 branch. For a time, C<mkpath> and
  C<rmtree> tried, unsuccessfully, to deal with the two different
  calling mechanisms. This approach was considered a failure.
  
  The new semantics are now only available with C<make_path> and
  C<remove_tree>. The old semantics are only available through
  C<mkpath> and C<rmtree>. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade
  to at least 2.08 in order to avoid surprises.
  
  =head3 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
  
  There were race conditions 1.x implementations of File::Path's
  C<rmtree> function (although sometimes patched depending on the OS
  distribution or platform). The 2.0 version contains code to avoid the
  problem mentioned in CVE-2002-0435.
  
  See the following pages for more information:
  
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286905
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2005/01/msg97623.html
    http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-696
  
  Additionally, unless the C<safe> parameter is set (or the
  third parameter in the traditional interface is TRUE), should a
  C<remove_tree> be interrupted, files that were originally in read-only
  mode may now have their permissions set to a read-write (or "delete
  OK") mode.
  
  =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
  
  FATAL errors will cause the program to halt (C<croak>), since the
  problem is so severe that it would be dangerous to continue. (This
  can always be trapped with C<eval>, but it's not a good idea. Under
  the circumstances, dying is the best thing to do).
  
  SEVERE errors may be trapped using the modern interface. If the
  they are not trapped, or the old interface is used, such an error
  will cause the program will halt.
  
  All other errors may be trapped using the modern interface, otherwise
  they will be C<carp>ed about. Program execution will not be halted.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item mkdir [path]: [errmsg] (SEVERE)
  
  C<make_path> was unable to create the path. Probably some sort of
  permissions error at the point of departure, or insufficient resources
  (such as free inodes on Unix).
  
  =item No root path(s) specified
  
  C<make_path> was not given any paths to create. This message is only
  emitted if the routine is called with the traditional interface.
  The modern interface will remain silent if given nothing to do.
  
  =item No such file or directory
  
  On Windows, if C<make_path> gives you this warning, it may mean that
  you have exceeded your filesystem's maximum path length.
  
  =item cannot fetch initial working directory: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> attempted to determine the initial directory by calling
  C<Cwd::getcwd>, but the call failed for some reason. No attempt
  will be made to delete anything.
  
  =item cannot stat initial working directory: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> attempted to stat the initial directory (after having
  successfully obtained its name via C<getcwd>), however, the call
  failed for some reason. No attempt will be made to delete anything.
  
  =item cannot chdir to [dir]: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> attempted to set the working directory in order to
  begin deleting the objects therein, but was unsuccessful. This is
  usually a permissions issue. The routine will continue to delete
  other things, but this directory will be left intact.
  
  =item directory [dir] changed before chdir, expected dev=[n] ino=[n], actual dev=[n] ino=[n], aborting. (FATAL)
  
  C<remove_tree> recorded the device and inode of a directory, and then
  moved into it. It then performed a C<stat> on the current directory
  and detected that the device and inode were no longer the same. As
  this is at the heart of the race condition problem, the program
  will die at this point.
  
  =item cannot make directory [dir] read+writeable: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> attempted to change the permissions on the current directory
  to ensure that subsequent unlinkings would not run into problems,
  but was unable to do so. The permissions remain as they were, and
  the program will carry on, doing the best it can.
  
  =item cannot read [dir]: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> tried to read the contents of the directory in order
  to acquire the names of the directory entries to be unlinked, but
  was unsuccessful. This is usually a permissions issue. The
  program will continue, but the files in this directory will remain
  after the call.
  
  =item cannot reset chmod [dir]: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree>, after having deleted everything in a directory, attempted
  to restore its permissions to the original state but failed. The
  directory may wind up being left behind.
  
  =item cannot remove [dir] when cwd is [dir]
  
  The current working directory of the program is F</some/path/to/here>
  and you are attempting to remove an ancestor, such as F</some/path>.
  The directory tree is left untouched.
  
  The solution is to C<chdir> out of the child directory to a place
  outside the directory tree to be removed.
  
  =item cannot chdir to [parent-dir] from [child-dir]: [errmsg], aborting. (FATAL)
  
  C<remove_tree>, after having deleted everything and restored the permissions
  of a directory, was unable to chdir back to the parent. The program
  halts to avoid a race condition from occurring.
  
  =item cannot stat prior working directory [dir]: [errmsg], aborting. (FATAL)
  
  C<remove_tree> was unable to stat the parent directory after have returned
  from the child. Since there is no way of knowing if we returned to
  where we think we should be (by comparing device and inode) the only
  way out is to C<croak>.
  
  =item previous directory [parent-dir] changed before entering [child-dir], expected dev=[n] ino=[n], actual dev=[n] ino=[n], aborting. (FATAL)
  
  When C<remove_tree> returned from deleting files in a child directory, a
  check revealed that the parent directory it returned to wasn't the one
  it started out from. This is considered a sign of malicious activity.
  
  =item cannot make directory [dir] writeable: [errmsg]
  
  Just before removing a directory (after having successfully removed
  everything it contained), C<remove_tree> attempted to set the permissions
  on the directory to ensure it could be removed and failed. Program
  execution continues, but the directory may possibly not be deleted.
  
  =item cannot remove directory [dir]: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> attempted to remove a directory, but failed. This may because
  some objects that were unable to be removed remain in the directory, or
  a permissions issue. The directory will be left behind.
  
  =item cannot restore permissions of [dir] to [0nnn]: [errmsg]
  
  After having failed to remove a directory, C<remove_tree> was unable to
  restore its permissions from a permissive state back to a possibly
  more restrictive setting. (Permissions given in octal).
  
  =item cannot make file [file] writeable: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> attempted to force the permissions of a file to ensure it
  could be deleted, but failed to do so. It will, however, still attempt
  to unlink the file.
  
  =item cannot unlink file [file]: [errmsg]
  
  C<remove_tree> failed to remove a file. Probably a permissions issue.
  
  =item cannot restore permissions of [file] to [0nnn]: [errmsg]
  
  After having failed to remove a file, C<remove_tree> was also unable
  to restore the permissions on the file to a possibly less permissive
  setting. (Permissions given in octal).
  
  =item unable to map [owner] to a uid, ownership not changed");
  
  C<make_path> was instructed to give the ownership of created
  directories to the symbolic name [owner], but C<getpwnam> did
  not return the corresponding numeric uid. The directory will
  be created, but ownership will not be changed.
  
  =item unable to map [group] to a gid, group ownership not changed
  
  C<make_path> was instructed to give the group ownership of created
  directories to the symbolic name [group], but C<getgrnam> did
  not return the corresponding numeric gid. The directory will
  be created, but group ownership will not be changed.

  =item *
  
  L<File::Remove>
  
  Allows files and directories to be moved to the Trashcan/Recycle
  Bin (where they may later be restored if necessary) if the operating
  system supports such functionality. This feature may one day be
  made available directly in C<File::Path>.
  
  =item *
  
  L<File::Find::Rule>
  
  When removing directory trees, if you want to examine each file to
  decide whether to delete it (and possibly leaving large swathes
  alone), F<File::Find::Rule> offers a convenient and flexible approach
  to examining directory trees.

  Paul Szabo identified the race condition originally, and Brendan
  O'Dea wrote an implementation for Debian that addressed the problem.
  That code was used as a basis for the current code. Their efforts
  are greatly appreciated.
  
  Gisle Aas made a number of improvements to the documentation for
  2.07 and his advice and assistance is also greatly appreciated.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<File::Temp> can be used to create and open temporary files in a safe
  way.  There is both a function interface and an object-oriented
  interface.  The File::Temp constructor or the tempfile() function can
  be used to return the name and the open filehandle of a temporary
  file.  The tempdir() function can be used to create a temporary
  directory.
  
  The security aspect of temporary file creation is emphasized such that
  a filehandle and filename are returned together.  This helps guarantee
  that a race condition can not occur where the temporary file is
  created by another process between checking for the existence of the
  file and its opening.  Additional security levels are provided to
  check, for example, that the sticky bit is set on world writable
  directories.  See L<"safe_level"> for more information.
  
  For compatibility with popular C library functions, Perl implementations of
  the mkstemp() family of functions are provided. These are, mkstemp(),
  mkstemps(), mkdtemp() and mktemp().
  
  Additionally, implementations of the standard L<POSIX|POSIX>
  tmpnam() and tmpfile() functions are provided if required.
  
  Implementations of mktemp(), tmpnam(), and tempnam() are provided,
  but should be used with caution since they return only a filename
  that was valid when function was called, so cannot guarantee
  that the file will not exist by the time the caller opens the filename.
  
  Filehandles returned by these functions support the seekable methods.

  =head1 PORTABILITY
  
  This section is at the top in order to provide easier access to
  porters.  It is not expected to be rendered by a standard pod
  formatting tool. Please skip straight to the SYNOPSIS section if you
  are not trying to port this module to a new platform.
  
  This module is designed to be portable across operating systems and it
  currently supports Unix, VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows and Mac OS
  (Classic). When porting to a new OS there are generally three main
  issues that have to be solved:
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  Can the OS unlink an open file? If it can not then the
  C<_can_unlink_opened_file> method should be modified.
  
  =item *
  
  Are the return values from C<stat> reliable? By default all the
  return values from C<stat> are compared when unlinking a temporary
  file using the filename and the handle. Operating systems other than
  unix do not always have valid entries in all fields. If utility function
  C<File::Temp::unlink0> fails then the C<stat> comparison should be
  modified accordingly.
  
  =item *
  
  Security. Systems that can not support a test for the sticky bit
  on a directory can not use the MEDIUM and HIGH security tests.
  The C<_can_do_level> method should be modified accordingly.
  
  =back
  
  =end __INTERNALS
  
  =head1 OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
  
  This is the primary interface for interacting with
  C<File::Temp>. Using the OO interface a temporary file can be created
  when the object is constructed and the file can be removed when the
  object is no longer required.
  
  Note that there is no method to obtain the filehandle from the
  C<File::Temp> object. The object itself acts as a filehandle.  The object
  isa C<IO::Handle> and isa C<IO::Seekable> so all those methods are
  available.
  
  Also, the object is configured such that it stringifies to the name of the
  temporary file and so can be compared to a filename directly.  It numifies
  to the C<refaddr> the same as other handles and so can be compared to other
  handles with C<==>.
  
      $fh eq $filename       # as a string
      $fh != \*STDOUT        # as a number
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<new>
  
  Create a temporary file object.
  
    my $tmp = File::Temp->new();
  
  by default the object is constructed as if C<tempfile>
  was called without options, but with the additional behaviour
  that the temporary file is removed by the object destructor
  if UNLINK is set to true (the default).
  
  Supported arguments are the same as for C<tempfile>: UNLINK
  (defaulting to true), DIR, EXLOCK and SUFFIX. Additionally, the filename
  template is specified using the TEMPLATE option. The OPEN option
  is not supported (the file is always opened).
  
   $tmp = File::Temp->new( TEMPLATE => 'tempXXXXX',
                          DIR => 'mydir',
                          SUFFIX => '.dat');
  
  Arguments are case insensitive.
  
  Can call croak() if an error occurs.
  
  =item B<newdir>
  
  Create a temporary directory using an object oriented interface.
  
    $dir = File::Temp->newdir();
  
  By default the directory is deleted when the object goes out of scope.
  
  Supports the same options as the C<tempdir> function. Note that directories
  created with this method default to CLEANUP => 1.
  
    $dir = File::Temp->newdir( $template, %options );
  
  A template may be specified either with a leading template or
  with a TEMPLATE argument.
  
  =item B<filename>
  
  Return the name of the temporary file associated with this object
  (if the object was created using the "new" constructor).
  
    $filename = $tmp->filename;
  
  This method is called automatically when the object is used as
  a string.
  
  =item B<dirname>
  
  Return the name of the temporary directory associated with this
  object (if the object was created using the "newdir" constructor).
  
    $dirname = $tmpdir->dirname;
  
  This method is called automatically when the object is used in string context.
  
  =item B<unlink_on_destroy>
  
  Control whether the file is unlinked when the object goes out of scope.
  The file is removed if this value is true and $KEEP_ALL is not.
  
   $fh->unlink_on_destroy( 1 );
  
  Default is for the file to be removed.
  
  =item B<DESTROY>
  
  When the object goes out of scope, the destructor is called. This
  destructor will attempt to unlink the file (using L<unlink1|"unlink1">)
  if the constructor was called with UNLINK set to 1 (the default state
  if UNLINK is not specified).
  
  No error is given if the unlink fails.
  
  If the object has been passed to a child process during a fork, the
  file will be deleted when the object goes out of scope in the parent.
  
  For a temporary directory object the directory will be removed unless
  the CLEANUP argument was used in the constructor (and set to false) or
  C<unlink_on_destroy> was modified after creation.  Note that if a temp
  directory is your current directory, it cannot be removed - a warning
  will be given in this case.  C<chdir()> out of the directory before
  letting the object go out of scope.
  
  If the global variable $KEEP_ALL is true, the file or directory
  will not be removed.

  =head1 FUNCTIONS
  
  This section describes the recommended interface for generating
  temporary files and directories.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<tempfile>
  
  This is the basic function to generate temporary files.
  The behaviour of the file can be changed using various options:
  
    $fh = tempfile();
    ($fh, $filename) = tempfile();
  
  Create a temporary file in  the directory specified for temporary
  files, as specified by the tmpdir() function in L<File::Spec>.
  
    ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template);
  
  Create a temporary file in the current directory using the supplied
  template.  Trailing `X' characters are replaced with random letters to
  generate the filename.  At least four `X' characters must be present
  at the end of the template.
  
    ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, SUFFIX => $suffix)
  
  Same as previously, except that a suffix is added to the template
  after the `X' translation.  Useful for ensuring that a temporary
  filename has a particular extension when needed by other applications.
  But see the WARNING at the end.
  
    ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, DIR => $dir);
  
  Translates the template as before except that a directory name
  is specified.
  
    ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, TMPDIR => 1);
  
  Equivalent to specifying a DIR of "File::Spec->tmpdir", writing the file
  into the same temporary directory as would be used if no template was
  specified at all.
  
    ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, UNLINK => 1);
  
  Return the filename and filehandle as before except that the file is
  automatically removed when the program exits (dependent on
  $KEEP_ALL). Default is for the file to be removed if a file handle is
  requested and to be kept if the filename is requested. In a scalar
  context (where no filename is returned) the file is always deleted
  either (depending on the operating system) on exit or when it is
  closed (unless $KEEP_ALL is true when the temp file is created).
  
  Use the object-oriented interface if fine-grained control of when
  a file is removed is required.
  
  If the template is not specified, a template is always
  automatically generated. This temporary file is placed in tmpdir()
  (L<File::Spec>) unless a directory is specified explicitly with the
  DIR option.
  
    $fh = tempfile( DIR => $dir );
  
  If called in scalar context, only the filehandle is returned and the
  file will automatically be deleted when closed on operating systems
  that support this (see the description of tmpfile() elsewhere in this
  document).  This is the preferred mode of operation, as if you only
  have a filehandle, you can never create a race condition by fumbling
  with the filename. On systems that can not unlink an open file or can
  not mark a file as temporary when it is opened (for example, Windows
  NT uses the C<O_TEMPORARY> flag) the file is marked for deletion when
  the program ends (equivalent to setting UNLINK to 1). The C<UNLINK>
  flag is ignored if present.
  
    (undef, $filename) = tempfile($template, OPEN => 0);
  
  This will return the filename based on the template but
  will not open this file.  Cannot be used in conjunction with
  UNLINK set to true. Default is to always open the file
  to protect from possible race conditions. A warning is issued
  if warnings are turned on. Consider using the tmpnam()
  and mktemp() functions described elsewhere in this document
  if opening the file is not required.
  
  If the operating system supports it (for example BSD derived systems), the 
  filehandle will be opened with O_EXLOCK (open with exclusive file lock). 
  This can sometimes cause problems if the intention is to pass the filename 
  to another system that expects to take an exclusive lock itself (such as 
  DBD::SQLite) whilst ensuring that the tempfile is not reused. In this 
  situation the "EXLOCK" option can be passed to tempfile. By default EXLOCK 
  will be true (this retains compatibility with earlier releases).
  
    ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, EXLOCK => 0);
  
  Options can be combined as required.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =item B<tempdir>
  
  This is the recommended interface for creation of temporary
  directories.  By default the directory will not be removed on exit
  (that is, it won't be temporary; this behaviour can not be changed
  because of issues with backwards compatibility). To enable removal
  either use the CLEANUP option which will trigger removal on program
  exit, or consider using the "newdir" method in the object interface which
  will allow the directory to be cleaned up when the object goes out of
  scope.
  
  The behaviour of the function depends on the arguments:
  
    $tempdir = tempdir();
  
  Create a directory in tmpdir() (see L<File::Spec|File::Spec>).
  
    $tempdir = tempdir( $template );
  
  Create a directory from the supplied template. This template is
  similar to that described for tempfile(). `X' characters at the end
  of the template are replaced with random letters to construct the
  directory name. At least four `X' characters must be in the template.
  
    $tempdir = tempdir ( DIR => $dir );
  
  Specifies the directory to use for the temporary directory.
  The temporary directory name is derived from an internal template.
  
    $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR => $dir );
  
  Prepend the supplied directory name to the template. The template
  should not include parent directory specifications itself. Any parent
  directory specifications are removed from the template before
  prepending the supplied directory.
  
    $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, TMPDIR => 1 );
  
  Using the supplied template, create the temporary directory in
  a standard location for temporary files. Equivalent to doing
  
    $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR => File::Spec->tmpdir);
  
  but shorter. Parent directory specifications are stripped from the
  template itself. The C<TMPDIR> option is ignored if C<DIR> is set
  explicitly.  Additionally, C<TMPDIR> is implied if neither a template
  nor a directory are supplied.
  
    $tempdir = tempdir( $template, CLEANUP => 1);
  
  Create a temporary directory using the supplied template, but
  attempt to remove it (and all files inside it) when the program
  exits. Note that an attempt will be made to remove all files from
  the directory even if they were not created by this module (otherwise
  why ask to clean it up?). The directory removal is made with
  the rmtree() function from the L<File::Path|File::Path> module.
  Of course, if the template is not specified, the temporary directory
  will be created in tmpdir() and will also be removed at program exit.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.

  =head1 MKTEMP FUNCTIONS
  
  The following functions are Perl implementations of the
  mktemp() family of temp file generation system calls.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<mkstemp>
  
  Given a template, returns a filehandle to the temporary file and the name
  of the file.
  
    ($fh, $name) = mkstemp( $template );
  
  In scalar context, just the filehandle is returned.
  
  The template may be any filename with some number of X's appended
  to it, for example F</tmp/temp.XXXX>. The trailing X's are replaced
  with unique alphanumeric combinations.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =item B<mkstemps>
  
  Similar to mkstemp(), except that an extra argument can be supplied
  with a suffix to be appended to the template.
  
    ($fh, $name) = mkstemps( $template, $suffix );
  
  For example a template of C<testXXXXXX> and suffix of C<.dat>
  would generate a file similar to F<testhGji_w.dat>.
  
  Returns just the filehandle alone when called in scalar context.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =item B<mkdtemp>
  
  Create a directory from a template. The template must end in
  X's that are replaced by the routine.
  
    $tmpdir_name = mkdtemp($template);
  
  Returns the name of the temporary directory created.
  
  Directory must be removed by the caller.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =item B<mktemp>
  
  Returns a valid temporary filename but does not guarantee
  that the file will not be opened by someone else.
  
    $unopened_file = mktemp($template);
  
  Template is the same as that required by mkstemp().
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 POSIX FUNCTIONS
  
  This section describes the re-implementation of the tmpnam()
  and tmpfile() functions described in L<POSIX>
  using the mkstemp() from this module.
  
  Unlike the L<POSIX|POSIX> implementations, the directory used
  for the temporary file is not specified in a system include
  file (C<P_tmpdir>) but simply depends on the choice of tmpdir()
  returned by L<File::Spec|File::Spec>. On some implementations this
  location can be set using the C<TMPDIR> environment variable, which
  may not be secure.
  If this is a problem, simply use mkstemp() and specify a template.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<tmpnam>
  
  When called in scalar context, returns the full name (including path)
  of a temporary file (uses mktemp()). The only check is that the file does
  not already exist, but there is no guarantee that that condition will
  continue to apply.
  
    $file = tmpnam();
  
  When called in list context, a filehandle to the open file and
  a filename are returned. This is achieved by calling mkstemp()
  after constructing a suitable template.
  
    ($fh, $file) = tmpnam();
  
  If possible, this form should be used to prevent possible
  race conditions.
  
  See L<File::Spec/tmpdir> for information on the choice of temporary
  directory for a particular operating system.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =item B<tmpfile>
  
  Returns the filehandle of a temporary file.
  
    $fh = tmpfile();
  
  The file is removed when the filehandle is closed or when the program
  exits. No access to the filename is provided.
  
  If the temporary file can not be created undef is returned.
  Currently this command will probably not work when the temporary
  directory is on an NFS file system.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS
  
  These functions are provided for backwards compatibility
  with common tempfile generation C library functions.
  
  They are not exported and must be addressed using the full package
  name.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<tempnam>
  
  Return the name of a temporary file in the specified directory
  using a prefix. The file is guaranteed not to exist at the time
  the function was called, but such guarantees are good for one
  clock tick only.  Always use the proper form of C<sysopen>
  with C<O_CREAT | O_EXCL> if you must open such a filename.
  
    $filename = File::Temp::tempnam( $dir, $prefix );
  
  Equivalent to running mktemp() with $dir/$prefixXXXXXXXX
  (using unix file convention as an example)
  
  Because this function uses mktemp(), it can suffer from race conditions.
  
  Will croak() if there is an error.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 UTILITY FUNCTIONS
  
  Useful functions for dealing with the filehandle and filename.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<unlink0>
  
  Given an open filehandle and the associated filename, make a safe
  unlink. This is achieved by first checking that the filename and
  filehandle initially point to the same file and that the number of
  links to the file is 1 (all fields returned by stat() are compared).
  Then the filename is unlinked and the filehandle checked once again to
  verify that the number of links on that file is now 0.  This is the
  closest you can come to making sure that the filename unlinked was the
  same as the file whose descriptor you hold.
  
    unlink0($fh, $path)
       or die "Error unlinking file $path safely";
  
  Returns false on error but croaks() if there is a security
  anomaly. The filehandle is not closed since on some occasions this is
  not required.
  
  On some platforms, for example Windows NT, it is not possible to
  unlink an open file (the file must be closed first). On those
  platforms, the actual unlinking is deferred until the program ends and
  good status is returned. A check is still performed to make sure that
  the filehandle and filename are pointing to the same thing (but not at
  the time the end block is executed since the deferred removal may not
  have access to the filehandle).
  
  Additionally, on Windows NT not all the fields returned by stat() can
  be compared. For example, the C<dev> and C<rdev> fields seem to be
  different.  Also, it seems that the size of the file returned by stat()
  does not always agree, with C<stat(FH)> being more accurate than
  C<stat(filename)>, presumably because of caching issues even when
  using autoflush (this is usually overcome by waiting a while after
  writing to the tempfile before attempting to C<unlink0> it).
  
  Finally, on NFS file systems the link count of the file handle does
  not always go to zero immediately after unlinking. Currently, this
  command is expected to fail on NFS disks.
  
  This function is disabled if the global variable $KEEP_ALL is true
  and an unlink on open file is supported. If the unlink is to be deferred
  to the END block, the file is still registered for removal.
  
  This function should not be called if you are using the object oriented
  interface since the it will interfere with the object destructor deleting
  the file.
  
  =item B<cmpstat>
  
  Compare C<stat> of filehandle with C<stat> of provided filename.  This
  can be used to check that the filename and filehandle initially point
  to the same file and that the number of links to the file is 1 (all
  fields returned by stat() are compared).
  
    cmpstat($fh, $path)
       or die "Error comparing handle with file";
  
  Returns false if the stat information differs or if the link count is
  greater than 1. Calls croak if there is a security anomaly.
  
  On certain platforms, for example Windows, not all the fields returned by stat()
  can be compared. For example, the C<dev> and C<rdev> fields seem to be
  different in Windows.  Also, it seems that the size of the file
  returned by stat() does not always agree, with C<stat(FH)> being more
  accurate than C<stat(filename)>, presumably because of caching issues
  even when using autoflush (this is usually overcome by waiting a while
  after writing to the tempfile before attempting to C<unlink0> it).
  
  Not exported by default.
  
  =item B<unlink1>
  
  Similar to C<unlink0> except after file comparison using cmpstat, the
  filehandle is closed prior to attempting to unlink the file. This
  allows the file to be removed without using an END block, but does
  mean that the post-unlink comparison of the filehandle state provided
  by C<unlink0> is not available.
  
    unlink1($fh, $path)
       or die "Error closing and unlinking file";
  
  Usually called from the object destructor when using the OO interface.
  
  Not exported by default.
  
  This function is disabled if the global variable $KEEP_ALL is true.
  
  Can call croak() if there is a security anomaly during the stat()
  comparison.
  
  =item B<cleanup>
  
  Calling this function will cause any temp files or temp directories
  that are registered for removal to be removed. This happens automatically
  when the process exits but can be triggered manually if the caller is sure
  that none of the temp files are required. This method can be registered as
  an Apache callback.
  
  Note that if a temp directory is your current directory, it cannot be
  removed.  C<chdir()> out of the directory first before calling
  C<cleanup()>. (For the cleanup at program exit when the CLEANUP flag
  is set, this happens automatically.)
  
  On OSes where temp files are automatically removed when the temp file
  is closed, calling this function will have no effect other than to remove
  temporary directories (which may include temporary files).
  
    File::Temp::cleanup();
  
  Not exported by default.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 PACKAGE VARIABLES
  
  These functions control the global state of the package.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item B<safe_level>
  
  Controls the lengths to which the module will go to check the safety of the
  temporary file or directory before proceeding.
  Options are:
  
  =over 8
  
  =item STANDARD
  
  Do the basic security measures to ensure the directory exists and is
  writable, that temporary files are opened only if they do not already
  exist, and that possible race conditions are avoided.  Finally the
  L<unlink0|"unlink0"> function is used to remove files safely.
  
  =item MEDIUM
  
  In addition to the STANDARD security, the output directory is checked
  to make sure that it is owned either by root or the user running the
  program. If the directory is writable by group or by other, it is then
  checked to make sure that the sticky bit is set.
  
  Will not work on platforms that do not support the C<-k> test
  for sticky bit.
  
  =item HIGH
  
  In addition to the MEDIUM security checks, also check for the
  possibility of ``chown() giveaway'' using the L<POSIX|POSIX>
  sysconf() function. If this is a possibility, each directory in the
  path is checked in turn for safeness, recursively walking back to the
  root directory.
  
  For platforms that do not support the L<POSIX|POSIX>
  C<_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED> symbol (for example, Windows NT) it is
  assumed that ``chown() giveaway'' is possible and the recursive test
  is performed.
  
  =back
  
  The level can be changed as follows:
  
    File::Temp->safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );
  
  The level constants are not exported by the module.
  
  Currently, you must be running at least perl v5.6.0 in order to
  run with MEDIUM or HIGH security. This is simply because the
  safety tests use functions from L<Fcntl|Fcntl> that are not
  available in older versions of perl. The problem is that the version
  number for Fcntl is the same in perl 5.6.0 and in 5.005_03 even though
  they are different versions.
  
  On systems that do not support the HIGH or MEDIUM safety levels
  (for example Win NT or OS/2) any attempt to change the level will
  be ignored. The decision to ignore rather than raise an exception
  allows portable programs to be written with high security in mind
  for the systems that can support this without those programs failing
  on systems where the extra tests are irrelevant.
  
  If you really need to see whether the change has been accepted
  simply examine the return value of C<safe_level>.
  
    $newlevel = File::Temp->safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );
    die "Could not change to high security"
        if $newlevel != File::Temp::HIGH;
  
  =item TopSystemUID
  
  This is the highest UID on the current system that refers to a root
  UID. This is used to make sure that the temporary directory is
  owned by a system UID (C<root>, C<bin>, C<sys> etc) rather than
  simply by root.
  
  This is required since on many unix systems C</tmp> is not owned
  by root.
  
  Default is to assume that any UID less than or equal to 10 is a root
  UID.
  
    File::Temp->top_system_uid(10);
    my $topid = File::Temp->top_system_uid;
  
  This value can be adjusted to reduce security checking if required.
  The value is only relevant when C<safe_level> is set to MEDIUM or higher.
  
  =item B<$KEEP_ALL>
  
  Controls whether temporary files and directories should be retained
  regardless of any instructions in the program to remove them
  automatically.  This is useful for debugging but should not be used in
  production code.
  
    $File::Temp::KEEP_ALL = 1;
  
  Default is for files to be removed as requested by the caller.
  
  In some cases, files will only be retained if this variable is true
  when the file is created. This means that you can not create a temporary
  file, set this variable and expect the temp file to still be around
  when the program exits.
  
  =item B<$DEBUG>
  
  Controls whether debugging messages should be enabled.
  
    $File::Temp::DEBUG = 1;
  
  Default is for debugging mode to be disabled.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 WARNING
  
  For maximum security, endeavour always to avoid ever looking at,
  touching, or even imputing the existence of the filename.  You do not
  know that that filename is connected to the same file as the handle
  you have, and attempts to check this can only trigger more race
  conditions.  It's far more secure to use the filehandle alone and
  dispense with the filename altogether.
  
  If you need to pass the handle to something that expects a filename
  then on a unix system you can use C<"/dev/fd/" . fileno($fh)> for
  arbitrary programs. Perl code that uses the 2-argument version of
  C<< open >> can be passed C<< "+<=&" . fileno($fh) >>. Otherwise you
  will need to pass the filename. You will have to clear the
  close-on-exec bit on that file descriptor before passing it to another
  process.
  
      use Fcntl qw/F_SETFD F_GETFD/;
      fcntl($tmpfh, F_SETFD, 0)
          or die "Can't clear close-on-exec flag on temp fh: $!\n";
  
  =head2 Temporary files and NFS
  
  Some problems are associated with using temporary files that reside
  on NFS file systems and it is recommended that a local filesystem
  is used whenever possible. Some of the security tests will most probably
  fail when the temp file is not local. Additionally, be aware that
  the performance of I/O operations over NFS will not be as good as for
  a local disk.
  
  =head2 Forking
  
  In some cases files created by File::Temp are removed from within an
  END block. Since END blocks are triggered when a child process exits
  (unless C<POSIX::_exit()> is used by the child) File::Temp takes care
  to only remove those temp files created by a particular process ID. This
  means that a child will not attempt to remove temp files created by the
  parent process.
  
  If you are forking many processes in parallel that are all creating
  temporary files, you may need to reset the random number seed using
  srand(EXPR) in each child else all the children will attempt to walk
  through the same set of random file names and may well cause
  themselves to give up if they exceed the number of retry attempts.
  
  =head2 Directory removal
  
  Note that if you have chdir'ed into the temporary directory and it is
  subsequently cleaned up (either in the END block or as part of object
  destruction), then you will get a warning from File::Path::rmtree().
  
  =head2 Taint mode
  
  If you need to run code under taint mode, updating to the latest
  L<File::Spec> is highly recommended.
  
  =head2 BINMODE
  
  The file returned by File::Temp will have been opened in binary mode
  if such a mode is available. If that is not correct, use the C<binmode()>
  function to change the mode of the filehandle.
  
  Note that you can modify the encoding of a file opened by File::Temp
  also by using C<binmode()>.
  
  =head1 HISTORY
  
  Originally began life in May 1999 as an XS interface to the system
  mkstemp() function. In March 2000, the OpenBSD mkstemp() code was
  translated to Perl for total control of the code's
  security checking, to ensure the presence of the function regardless of
  operating system and to help with portability. The module was shipped
  as a standard part of perl from v5.6.1.
  
  Thanks to Tom Christiansen for suggesting that this module
  should be written and providing ideas for code improvements and
  security enhancements.

$fatpacked{"i686-linux/Cwd.pm"} = '#line '.(1+__LINE__).' "'.__FILE__."\"\n".<<'I686-LINUX_CWD';
  package Cwd;
  
  =head1 NAME
  
  Cwd - get pathname of current working directory
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Cwd;
      my $dir = getcwd;
  
      use Cwd 'abs_path';
      my $abs_path = abs_path($file);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides functions for determining the pathname of the
  current working directory.  It is recommended that getcwd (or another
  *cwd() function) be used in I<all> code to ensure portability.
  
  By default, it exports the functions cwd(), getcwd(), fastcwd(), and
  fastgetcwd() (and, on Win32, getdcwd()) into the caller's namespace.  
  
  
  =head2 getcwd and friends
  
  Each of these functions are called without arguments and return the
  absolute path of the current working directory.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item getcwd
  
      my $cwd = getcwd();
  
  Returns the current working directory.
  
  Exposes the POSIX function getcwd(3) or re-implements it if it's not
  available.
  
  =item cwd
  
      my $cwd = cwd();
  
  The cwd() is the most natural form for the current architecture.  For
  most systems it is identical to `pwd` (but without the trailing line
  terminator).
  
  =item fastcwd
  
      my $cwd = fastcwd();
  
  A more dangerous version of getcwd(), but potentially faster.
  
  It might conceivably chdir() you out of a directory that it can't
  chdir() you back into.  If fastcwd encounters a problem it will return
  undef but will probably leave you in a different directory.  For a
  measure of extra security, if everything appears to have worked, the
  fastcwd() function will check that it leaves you in the same directory
  that it started in.  If it has changed it will C<die> with the message
  "Unstable directory path, current directory changed
  unexpectedly".  That should never happen.
  
  =item fastgetcwd
  
    my $cwd = fastgetcwd();
  
  The fastgetcwd() function is provided as a synonym for cwd().
  
  =item getdcwd
  
      my $cwd = getdcwd();
      my $cwd = getdcwd('C:');
  
  The getdcwd() function is also provided on Win32 to get the current working
  directory on the specified drive, since Windows maintains a separate current
  working directory for each drive.  If no drive is specified then the current
  drive is assumed.
  
  This function simply calls the Microsoft C library _getdcwd() function.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 abs_path and friends
  
  These functions are exported only on request.  They each take a single
  argument and return the absolute pathname for it.  If no argument is
  given they'll use the current working directory.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item abs_path
  
    my $abs_path = abs_path($file);
  
  Uses the same algorithm as getcwd().  Symbolic links and relative-path
  components ("." and "..") are resolved to return the canonical
  pathname, just like realpath(3).
  
  =item realpath
  
    my $abs_path = realpath($file);
  
  A synonym for abs_path().
  
  =item fast_abs_path
  
    my $abs_path = fast_abs_path($file);
  
  A more dangerous, but potentially faster version of abs_path.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 $ENV{PWD}
  
  If you ask to override your chdir() built-in function, 
  
    use Cwd qw(chdir);
  
  then your PWD environment variable will be kept up to date.  Note that
  it will only be kept up to date if all packages which use chdir import
  it from Cwd.
  
  
  =head1 NOTES
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  Since the path separators are different on some operating systems ('/'
  on Unix, ':' on MacPerl, etc...) we recommend you use the File::Spec
  modules wherever portability is a concern.
  
  =item *
  
  Actually, on Mac OS, the C<getcwd()>, C<fastgetcwd()> and C<fastcwd()>
  functions are all aliases for the C<cwd()> function, which, on Mac OS,
  calls `pwd`.  Likewise, the C<abs_path()> function is an alias for
  C<fast_abs_path()>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  File::Spec - portably perform operations on file names
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  	use File::Spec;
  
  	$x=File::Spec->catfile('a', 'b', 'c');
  
  which returns 'a/b/c' under Unix. Or:
  
  	use File::Spec::Functions;
  
  	$x = catfile('a', 'b', 'c');
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file
  specifications (usually called "file names", but not to be confused with the
  contents of a file, or Perl's file handles), such as concatenating several
  directory and file names into a single path, or determining whether a path
  is rooted. It is based on code directly taken from MakeMaker 5.17, code
  written by Andreas KE<ouml>nig, Andy Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya
  Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.
  
  Since these functions are different for most operating systems, each set of
  OS specific routines is available in a separate module, including:
  
  	File::Spec::Unix
  	File::Spec::Mac
  	File::Spec::OS2
  	File::Spec::Win32
  	File::Spec::VMS
  
  The module appropriate for the current OS is automatically loaded by
  File::Spec. Since some modules (like VMS) make use of facilities available
  only under that OS, it may not be possible to load all modules under all
  operating systems.
  
  Since File::Spec is object oriented, subroutines should not be called directly,
  as in:
  
  	File::Spec::catfile('a','b');
  
  but rather as class methods:
  
  	File::Spec->catfile('a','b');
  
  For simple uses, L<File::Spec::Functions> provides convenient functional
  forms of these methods.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =over 2
  
  =item canonpath
  X<canonpath>
  
  No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
  path.
  
      $cpath = File::Spec->canonpath( $path ) ;
  
  Note that this does *not* collapse F<x/../y> sections into F<y>.  This
  is by design.  If F</foo> on your system is a symlink to F</bar/baz>,
  then F</foo/../quux> is actually F</bar/quux>, not F</quux> as a naive
  F<../>-removal would give you.  If you want to do this kind of
  processing, you probably want C<Cwd>'s C<realpath()> function to
  actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.
  
  =item catdir
  X<catdir>
  
  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending
  with a directory. But remove the trailing slash from the resulting
  string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and confuses
  OS/2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the
  trailing slash :-)
  
      $path = File::Spec->catdir( @directories );
  
  =item catfile
  X<catfile>
  
  Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a
  complete path ending with a filename
  
      $path = File::Spec->catfile( @directories, $filename );
  
  =item curdir
  X<curdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the current directory.
  
      $curdir = File::Spec->curdir();
  
  =item devnull
  X<devnull>
  
  Returns a string representation of the null device.
  
      $devnull = File::Spec->devnull();
  
  =item rootdir
  X<rootdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the root directory.
  
      $rootdir = File::Spec->rootdir();
  
  =item tmpdir
  X<tmpdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from a
  list of possible temporary directories.  Returns the current directory
  if no writable temporary directories are found.  The list of directories
  checked depends on the platform; e.g. File::Spec::Unix checks C<$ENV{TMPDIR}>
  (unless taint is on) and F</tmp>.
  
      $tmpdir = File::Spec->tmpdir();
  
  =item updir
  X<updir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the parent directory.
  
      $updir = File::Spec->updir();
  
  =item no_upwards
  
  Given a list of file names, strip out those that refer to a parent
  directory. (Does not strip symlinks, only '.', '..', and equivalents.)
  
      @paths = File::Spec->no_upwards( @paths );
  
  =item case_tolerant
  
  Returns a true or false value indicating, respectively, that alphabetic
  case is not or is significant when comparing file specifications.
  Cygwin and Win32 accept an optional drive argument.
  
      $is_case_tolerant = File::Spec->case_tolerant();
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as its argument a path, and returns true if it is an absolute path.
  
      $is_absolute = File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute( $path );
  
  This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2, or
  Mac OS (Classic).  It does consult the working environment for VMS
  (see L<File::Spec::VMS/file_name_is_absolute>).
  
  =item path
  X<path>
  
  Takes no argument.  Returns the environment variable C<PATH> (or the local
  platform's equivalent) as a list.
  
      @PATH = File::Spec->path();
  
  =item join
  X<join, path>
  
  join is the same as catfile.
  
  =item splitpath
  X<splitpath> X<split, path>
  
  Splits a path in to volume, directory, and filename portions. On systems
  with no concept of volume, returns '' for volume. 
  
      ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                         File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
      ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                         File::Spec->splitpath( $path, $no_file );
  
  For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, 
  assumes that the last file is a path unless C<$no_file> is true or a
  trailing separator or F</.> or F</..> is present. On Unix, this means that C<$no_file>
  true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).
  
  The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.
  
  The results can be passed to L</catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.
  
  =item splitdir
  X<splitdir> X<split, dir>
  
  The opposite of L</catdir>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  C<$directories> must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty
  directory names (C<''>) can be returned, because these are significant
  on some OSes.
  
  =item catpath()
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
  Unix, C<$volume> is ignored, and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is
  inserted if need be.  On other OSes, C<$volume> is significant.
  
      $full_path = File::Spec->catpath( $volume, $directory, $file );
  
  =item abs2rel
  X<abs2rel> X<absolute, path> X<relative, path>
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If C<$base> is not present or '', then L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd> is used. If C<$base> is
  relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
  L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
  L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems with the concept of volume, if C<$path> and C<$base> appear to be
  on two different volumes, we will not attempt to resolve the two
  paths, and we will instead simply return C<$path>.  Note that previous
  versions of this module ignored the volume of C<$base>, which resulted in
  garbage results part of the time.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  C<$base> filename as well. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If C<$path> is relative, it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
  interaction with the working environment, as logicals and
  macros are expanded.
  
  Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.
  
  =item rel2abs()
  X<rel2abs> X<absolute, path> X<relative, path>
  
  Converts a relative path to an absolute path. 
  
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path ) ;
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If C<$base> is not present or '', then L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd> is used. If C<$base> is relative,
  then it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>. This means that it
  is taken to be relative to L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems with the concept of volume, if C<$path> and C<$base> appear to be
  on two different volumes, we will not attempt to resolve the two
  paths, and we will instead simply return C<$path>.  Note that previous
  versions of this module ignored the volume of C<$base>, which resulted in
  garbage results part of the time.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  C<$base> filename as well. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If C<$path> is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using L</canonpath>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
  interaction with the working environment, as logicals and
  macros are expanded.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Methods for manipulating file specifications.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =over 2
  
  =item canonpath
  
  On Mac OS, there's nothing to be done. Returns what it's given.
  
  =cut
  
  sub canonpath {
      my ($self,$path) = @_;
      return $path;
  }
  
  =item catdir()
  
  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a path separated by colons
  (":") ending with a directory. Resulting paths are B<relative> by default,
  but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this, see below). Automatically
  puts a trailing ":" on the end of the complete path, because that's what's
  done in MacPerl's environment and helps to distinguish a file path from a
  directory path.
  
  B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the resulting
  path is relative by default and I<not> absolute. This decision was made due
  to portability reasons. Since C<File::Spec-E<gt>catdir()> returns relative paths
  on all other operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac
  OS. Note that this may break some existing scripts.
  
  The intended purpose of this routine is to concatenate I<directory names>.
  But because of the nature of Macintosh paths, some additional possibilities
  are allowed to make using this routine give reasonable results for some
  common situations. In other words, you are also allowed to concatenate
  I<paths> instead of directory names (strictly speaking, a string like ":a"
  is a path, but not a name, since it contains a punctuation character ":").
  
  So, beside calls like
  
      catdir("a") = ":a:"
      catdir("a","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir() = ""                    (special case)
  
  calls like the following
  
      catdir(":a:") = ":a:"
      catdir(":a","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":a:","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":a:",":b:") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":") = ":"
  
  are allowed.
  
  Here are the rules that are used in C<catdir()>; note that we try to be as
  compatible as possible to Unix:
  
  =over 2
  
  =item 1.
  
  The resulting path is relative by default, i.e. the resulting path will have a
  leading colon.
  
  =item 2.
  
  A trailing colon is added automatically to the resulting path, to denote a
  directory.
  
  =item 3.
  
  Generally, each argument has one leading ":" and one trailing ":"
  removed (if any). They are then joined together by a ":". Special
  treatment applies for arguments denoting updir paths like "::lib:",
  see (4), or arguments consisting solely of colons ("colon paths"),
  see (5).
  
  =item 4.
  
  When an updir path like ":::lib::" is passed as argument, the number
  of directories to climb up is handled correctly, not removing leading
  or trailing colons when necessary. E.g.
  
      catdir(":::a","::b","c")    = ":::a::b:c:"
      catdir(":::a::","::b","c")  = ":::a:::b:c:"
  
  =item 5.
  
  Adding a colon ":" or empty string "" to a path at I<any> position
  doesn't alter the path, i.e. these arguments are ignored. (When a ""
  is passed as the first argument, it has a special meaning, see
  (6)). This way, a colon ":" is handled like a "." (curdir) on Unix,
  while an empty string "" is generally ignored (see
  C<Unix-E<gt>canonpath()> ). Likewise, a "::" is handled like a ".."
  (updir), and a ":::" is handled like a "../.." etc.  E.g.
  
      catdir("a",":",":","b")   = ":a:b:"
      catdir("a",":","::",":b") = ":a::b:"
  
  =item 6.
  
  If the first argument is an empty string "" or is a volume name, i.e. matches
  the pattern /^[^:]+:/, the resulting path is B<absolute>.
  
  =item 7.
  
  Passing an empty string "" as the first argument to C<catdir()> is
  like passingC<File::Spec-E<gt>rootdir()> as the first argument, i.e.
  
      catdir("","a","b")          is the same as
  
      catdir(rootdir(),"a","b").
  
  This is true on Unix, where C<catdir("","a","b")> yields "/a/b" and
  C<rootdir()> is "/". Note that C<rootdir()> on Mac OS is the startup
  volume, which is the closest in concept to Unix' "/". This should help
  to run existing scripts originally written for Unix.
  
  =item 8.
  
  For absolute paths, some cleanup is done, to ensure that the volume
  name isn't immediately followed by updirs. This is invalid, because
  this would go beyond "root". Generally, these cases are handled like
  their Unix counterparts:
  
   Unix:
      Unix->catdir("","")                 =  "/"
      Unix->catdir("",".")                =  "/"
      Unix->catdir("","..")               =  "/"        # can't go
                                                        # beyond root
      Unix->catdir("",".","..","..","a")  =  "/a"
   Mac:
      Mac->catdir("","")                  =  rootdir()  # (e.g. "HD:")
      Mac->catdir("",":")                 =  rootdir()
      Mac->catdir("","::")                =  rootdir()  # can't go
                                                        # beyond root
      Mac->catdir("",":","::","::","a")   =  rootdir() . "a:"
                                                      # (e.g. "HD:a:")
  
  However, this approach is limited to the first arguments following
  "root" (again, see C<Unix-E<gt>canonpath()> ). If there are more
  arguments that move up the directory tree, an invalid path going
  beyond root can be created.
  
  =back
  
  As you've seen, you can force C<catdir()> to create an absolute path
  by passing either an empty string or a path that begins with a volume
  name as the first argument. However, you are strongly encouraged not
  to do so, since this is done only for backward compatibility. Newer
  versions of File::Spec come with a method called C<catpath()> (see
  below), that is designed to offer a portable solution for the creation
  of absolute paths.  It takes volume, directory and file portions and
  returns an entire path. While C<catdir()> is still suitable for the
  concatenation of I<directory names>, you are encouraged to use
  C<catpath()> to concatenate I<volume names> and I<directory
  paths>. E.g.
  
      $dir      = File::Spec->catdir("tmp","sources");
      $abs_path = File::Spec->catpath("MacintoshHD:", $dir,"");
  
  yields
  
      "MacintoshHD:tmp:sources:" .
  
  =cut

  					$arg = shift @args;
  					$updir_count += (length($arg) - 1);
  				}
  				$arg = (':' x $updir_count);
  			} else {
  				$arg =~ s/^://s; # remove a leading ':' if any
  				$arg = "$arg:" unless ($arg =~ /:\Z(?!\n)/); # ensure trailing ':'
  			}
  			$result .= $arg;
  		}#unless
  	}
  
  	if ( ($relative) && ($result !~ /^:/) ) {
  		# add a leading colon if need be

  	}
  
  	unless ($relative) {
  		# remove updirs immediately following the volume name
  		$result =~ s/([^:]+:)(:*)(.*)\Z(?!\n)/$1$3/;

  }
  
  =item catfile
  
  Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a
  complete path ending with a filename. Resulting paths are B<relative>
  by default, but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this).
  
  B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the
  resulting path is relative by default and I<not> absolute. This
  decision was made due to portability reasons. Since
  C<File::Spec-E<gt>catfile()> returns relative paths on all other
  operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac OS.
  Note that this may break some existing scripts.
  
  The last argument is always considered to be the file portion. Since
  C<catfile()> uses C<catdir()> (see above) for the concatenation of the
  directory portions (if any), the following with regard to relative and
  absolute paths is true:
  
      catfile("")     = ""
      catfile("file") = "file"
  
  but
  
      catfile("","")        = rootdir()         # (e.g. "HD:")
      catfile("","file")    = rootdir() . file  # (e.g. "HD:file")
      catfile("HD:","file") = "HD:file"
  
  This means that C<catdir()> is called only when there are two or more
  arguments, as one might expect.
  
  Note that the leading ":" is removed from the filename, so that
  
      catfile("a","b","file")  = ":a:b:file"    and
  
      catfile("a","b",":file") = ":a:b:file"
  
  give the same answer.
  
  To concatenate I<volume names>, I<directory paths> and I<filenames>,
  you are encouraged to use C<catpath()> (see below).
  
  =cut
  
  sub catfile {
      my $self = shift;
      return '' unless @_;
      my $file = pop @_;
      return $file unless @_;
      my $dir = $self->catdir(@_);
      $file =~ s/^://s;
      return $dir.$file;
  }
  
  =item curdir
  
  Returns a string representing the current directory. On Mac OS, this is ":".
  
  =cut
  
  sub curdir {
      return ":";
  }
  
  =item devnull
  
  Returns a string representing the null device. On Mac OS, this is "Dev:Null".
  
  =cut
  
  sub devnull {
      return "Dev:Null";
  }
  
  =item rootdir
  
  Returns a string representing the root directory.  Under MacPerl,
  returns the name of the startup volume, since that's the closest in
  concept, although other volumes aren't rooted there. The name has a
  trailing ":", because that's the correct specification for a volume
  name on Mac OS.
  
  If Mac::Files could not be loaded, the empty string is returned.
  
  =cut
  
  sub rootdir {
  #
  #  There's no real root directory on Mac OS. The name of the startup
  #  volume is returned, since that's the closest in concept.
  #
      return '' unless $macfiles;
      my $system = Mac::Files::FindFolder(&Mac::Files::kOnSystemDisk,
  	&Mac::Files::kSystemFolderType);
      $system =~ s/:.*\Z(?!\n)/:/s;
      return $system;
  }
  
  =item tmpdir
  
  Returns the contents of $ENV{TMPDIR}, if that directory exits or the
  current working directory otherwise. Under MacPerl, $ENV{TMPDIR} will
  contain a path like "MacintoshHD:Temporary Items:", which is a hidden
  directory on your startup volume.
  
  =cut
  
  my $tmpdir;
  sub tmpdir {
      return $tmpdir if defined $tmpdir;
      $tmpdir = $_[0]->_tmpdir( $ENV{TMPDIR} );
  }
  
  =item updir
  
  Returns a string representing the parent directory. On Mac OS, this is "::".
  
  =cut
  
  sub updir {
      return "::";
  }
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as argument a path and returns true, if it is an absolute path.
  If the path has a leading ":", it's a relative path. Otherwise, it's an
  absolute path, unless the path doesn't contain any colons, i.e. it's a name
  like "a". In this particular case, the path is considered to be relative
  (i.e. it is considered to be a filename). Use ":" in the appropriate place
  in the path if you want to distinguish unambiguously. As a special case,
  the filename '' is always considered to be absolute. Note that with version
  1.2 of File::Spec::Mac, this does no longer consult the local filesystem.
  
  E.g.
  
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("a");         # false (relative)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute(":a:b:");     # false (relative)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("MacintoshHD:");
                                                      # true (absolute)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("");          # true (absolute)
  
  
  =cut
  
  sub file_name_is_absolute {
      my ($self,$file) = @_;
      if ($file =~ /:/) {
  	return (! ($file =~ m/^:/s) );
      } elsif ( $file eq '' ) {
          return 1 ;
      } else {
  	return 0; # i.e. a file like "a"
      }
  }
  
  =item path
  
  Returns the null list for the MacPerl application, since the concept is
  usually meaningless under Mac OS. But if you're using the MacPerl tool under
  MPW, it gives back $ENV{Commands} suitably split, as is done in
  :lib:ExtUtils:MM_Mac.pm.
  
  =cut
  
  sub path {
  #
  #  The concept is meaningless under the MacPerl application.
  #  Under MPW, it has a meaning.
  #
      return unless exists $ENV{Commands};
      return split(/,/, $ENV{Commands});
  }
  
  =item splitpath
  
      ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
      ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path,
                                                            $no_file );
  
  Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions.
  
  On Mac OS, assumes that the last part of the path is a filename unless
  $no_file is true or a trailing separator ":" is present.
  
  The volume portion is always returned with a trailing ":". The directory portion
  is always returned with a leading (to denote a relative path) and a trailing ":"
  (to denote a directory). The file portion is always returned I<without> a leading ":".
  Empty portions are returned as empty string ''.
  
  The results can be passed to C<catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.
  
  
  =cut
  
  sub splitpath {
      my ($self,$path, $nofile) = @_;
      my ($volume,$directory,$file);
  
      if ( $nofile ) {
          ( $volume, $directory ) = $path =~ m|^((?:[^:]+:)?)(.*)|s;
      }
      else {
          $path =~
              m|^( (?: [^:]+: )? )
                 ( (?: .*: )? )
                 ( .* )
               |xs;
          $volume    = $1;
          $directory = $2;
          $file      = $3;
      }
  
      $volume = '' unless defined($volume);
  	$directory = ":$directory" if ( $volume && $directory ); # take care of "HD::dir"
      if ($directory) {
          # Make sure non-empty directories begin and end in ':'
          $directory .= ':' unless (substr($directory,-1) eq ':');
          $directory = ":$directory" unless (substr($directory,0,1) eq ':');
      } else {
  	$directory = '';
      }
      $file = '' unless defined($file);
  
      return ($volume,$directory,$file);
  }
  
  
  =item splitdir
  
  The opposite of C<catdir()>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  $directories should be only the directory portion of the path on systems
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories. Consider using C<splitpath()> otherwise.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty directory names
  (C<"">) can be returned. Since C<catdir()> on Mac OS always appends a trailing
  colon to distinguish a directory path from a file path, a single trailing colon
  will be ignored, i.e. there's no empty directory name after it.
  
  Hence, on Mac OS, both
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c:" );    and
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c" );
  
  yield:
  
      ( "a", "b", "::", "c")
  
  while
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c::" );
  
  yields:

      $path = File::Spec->catpath($volume,$directory,$file);
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. On Mac OS,
  $volume, $directory and $file are concatenated.  A ':' is inserted if need be. You
  may pass an empty string for each portion. If all portions are empty, the empty
  string is returned. If $volume is empty, the result will be a relative path,
  beginning with a ':'. If $volume and $directory are empty, a leading ":" (if any)
  is removed form $file and the remainder is returned. If $file is empty, the
  resulting path will have a trailing ':'.

  =item abs2rel
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path and returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  Note that both paths are assumed to have a notation that distinguishes a
  directory path (with trailing ':') from a file path (without trailing ':').
  
  If $base is not present or '', then the current working directory is used.
  If $base is relative, then it is converted to absolute form using C<rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to the current working directory.
  
  If $path and $base appear to be on two different volumes, we will not
  attempt to resolve the two paths, and we will instead simply return
  $path.  Note that previous versions of this module ignored the volume
  of $base, which resulted in garbage results part of the time.
  
  If $base doesn't have a trailing colon, the last element of $base is
  assumed to be a filename.  This filename is ignored.  Otherwise all path
  components are assumed to be directories.
  
  If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using C<rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to the current working directory.

  Note that both paths are assumed to have a notation that distinguishes a

  If $base is not present or '', then $base is set to the current working
  directory. If $base is relative, then it is converted to absolute form
  using C<rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to the
  current working directory.
  
  If $base doesn't have a trailing colon, the last element of $base is
  assumed to be a filename.  This filename is ignored.  Otherwise all path

  If $path is already absolute, it is returned and $base is ignored.

  =item canonpath()
  
  No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
  path. On UNIX eliminates successive slashes and successive "/.".
  
      $cpath = File::Spec->canonpath( $path ) ;
  
  Note that this does *not* collapse F<x/../y> sections into F<y>.  This
  is by design.  If F</foo> on your system is a symlink to F</bar/baz>,
  then F</foo/../quux> is actually F</bar/quux>, not F</quux> as a naive
  F<../>-removal would give you.  If you want to do this kind of
  processing, you probably want C<Cwd>'s C<realpath()> function to
  actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.

  =item catdir()
  
  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending
  with a directory. But remove the trailing slash from the resulting
  string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and confuses
  OS2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the
  trailing slash :-)

  =item curdir
  
  Returns a string representation of the current directory.  "." on UNIX.
  
  =cut

  Returns a string representation of the root directory.  "/" on UNIX.

  Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from
  the following list or the current directory if none from the list are
  writable:
  
      $ENV{TMPDIR}
      /tmp
  
  If running under taint mode, and if $ENV{TMPDIR}
  is tainted, it is not used.

  is not or is significant when comparing file specifications.
  
  =cut
  
  sub case_tolerant { 0 }
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as argument a path and returns true if it is an absolute path.
  
  This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2 or Mac 
  OS (Classic).  It does consult the working environment for VMS (see
  L<File::Spec::VMS/file_name_is_absolute>).
  
  =cut
  
  sub file_name_is_absolute {
      my ($self,$file) = @_;
      return scalar($file =~ m:^/:s);
  }
  
  =item path
  
  Takes no argument, returns the environment variable PATH as an array.
  
  =cut
  
  sub path {
      return () unless exists $ENV{PATH};
      my @path = split(':', $ENV{PATH});
      foreach (@path) { $_ = '.' if $_ eq '' }
      return @path;
  }
  
  =item join
  
  join is the same as catfile.
  
  =cut
  
  sub join {
      my $self = shift;
      return $self->catfile(@_);
  }
  
  =item splitpath

                                                            $no_file );
  
  Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions. On systems
  with no concept of volume, returns '' for volume. 
  
  For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, 
  assumes that the last file is a path unless $no_file is true or a 
  trailing separator or /. or /.. is present. On Unix this means that $no_file
  true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).
  
  The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.
  
  The results can be passed to L</catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.
  
  =cut
  
  sub splitpath {
      my ($self,$path, $nofile) = @_;
  
      my ($volume,$directory,$file) = ('','','');
  
      if ( $nofile ) {
          $directory = $path;
      }
      else {
          $path =~ m|^ ( (?: .* / (?: \.\.?\z )? )? ) ([^/]*) |xs;
          $directory = $1;
          $file      = $2;
      }
  
      return ($volume,$directory,$file);
  }
  
  
  =item splitdir
  
  The opposite of L</catdir()>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  $directories must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty
  directory names (C<''>) can be returned, because these are significant
  on some OSs.
  
  On Unix,
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( "/a/b//c/" );
  
  Yields:
  
      ( '', 'a', 'b', '', 'c', '' )
  
  =cut
  
  sub splitdir {
      return split m|/|, $_[1], -1;  # Preserve trailing fields
  }
  
  
  =item catpath()
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
  Unix, $volume is ignored, and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is
  inserted if needed (though if the directory portion doesn't start with
  '/' it is not added).  On other OSs, $volume is significant.
  
  =cut
  
  sub catpath {
      my ($self,$volume,$directory,$file) = @_;
  
      if ( $directory ne ''                && 
           $file ne ''                     && 
           substr( $directory, -1 ) ne '/' && 
           substr( $file, 0, 1 ) ne '/' 
      ) {
          $directory .= "/$file" ;
      }
      else {
          $directory .= $file ;
      }
  
      return $directory ;
  }
  
  =item abs2rel
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If $base is not present or '', then L<cwd()|Cwd> is used. If $base is
  relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
  L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
  L<cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  $base filename. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to L<cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made, so the result may not be correct if
  C<$base> contains symbolic links.  (Apply
  L<Cwd::abs_path()|Cwd/abs_path> beforehand if that
  is a concern.)  On VMS, there is interaction with the working environment, as
  logicals and macros are expanded.

  File::Spec::VMS - methods for VMS file specs
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   require File::Spec::VMS; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  See File::Spec::Unix for a documentation of the methods provided
  there. This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not
  the semantics.
  
  The default behavior is to allow either VMS or Unix syntax on input and to 
  return VMS syntax on output unless Unix syntax has been explicity requested
  via the C<DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT> CRTL feature.

  =item devnull
  
  Returns a string representation of the null device.
  
  =cut
  
  sub devnull {
      return "nul";
  }
  
  sub rootdir { '\\' }
  
  
  =item tmpdir
  
  Returns a string representation of the first existing directory
  from the following list:
  
      $ENV{TMPDIR}
      $ENV{TEMP}
      $ENV{TMP}
      SYS:/temp
      C:\system\temp
      C:/temp
      /tmp
      /
  
  The SYS:/temp is preferred in Novell NetWare and the C:\system\temp
  for Symbian (the File::Spec::Win32 is used also for those platforms).
  
  Since Perl 5.8.0, if running under taint mode, and if the environment
  variables are tainted, they are not used.

  			      'C:/temp',
  			      '/tmp',
  			      '/'  );
  }
  
  =item case_tolerant
  
  MSWin32 case-tolerance depends on GetVolumeInformation() $ouFsFlags == FS_CASE_SENSITIVE,
  indicating the case significance when comparing file specifications.
  Since XP FS_CASE_SENSITIVE is effectively disabled for the NT subsubsystem.
  See http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2007-07/msg00891.html

  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  As of right now, this returns 2 if the path is absolute with a
  volume, 1 if it's absolute with no volume, 0 otherwise.

  =item canonpath
  
  No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
  path. On UNIX eliminated successive slashes and successive "/.".
  On Win32 makes 
  
  	dir1\dir2\dir3\..\..\dir4 -> \dir\dir4 and even
  	dir1\dir2\dir3\...\dir4   -> \dir\dir4
  
  =cut

  Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions. Assumes that 
  the last file is a path unless the path ends in '\\', '\\.', '\\..'
  or $no_file is true.  On Win32 this means that $no_file true makes this return 
  ( $volume, $path, '' ).
  
  Separators accepted are \ and /.
  
  Volumes can be drive letters or UNC sharenames (\\server\share).
  
  The results can be passed to L</catpath> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.

  =item splitdir
  
  The opposite of L<catdir()|File::Spec/catdir>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  $directories must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, leading empty and 
  trailing directory entries can be returned, because these are significant
  on some OSs. So,
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( "/a/b/c" );
  
  Yields:
  
      ( '', 'a', 'b', '', 'c', '' )
  
  =cut
  
  sub splitdir {
      my ($self,$directories) = @_ ;
      #
      # split() likes to forget about trailing null fields, so here we
      # check to be sure that there will not be any before handling the
      # simple case.
      #
      if ( $directories !~ m|[\\/]\Z(?!\n)| ) {
          return split( m|[\\/]|, $directories );
      }
      else {
          #
          # since there was a trailing separator, add a file name to the end, 
          # then do the split, then replace it with ''.
          #
          my( @directories )= split( m|[\\/]|, "${directories}dummy" ) ;
          $directories[ $#directories ]= '' ;
          return @directories ;
      }
  }
  
  
  =item catpath
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
  Unix, $volume is ignored, and this is just like catfile(). On other OSs,
  the $volume become significant.

=head1 NAME

patchperl - patch a perl source tree

=head1 VERSION

version 2.08

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  patchperl

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=over

=item C<--version>

Prints the version of L<Devel::PatchPerl> to STDOUT and exits

=item C<--patchlevel>

Devel::PatchPerl will normally update the C<patchlevel.h> file in the perl source tree
to indicate that it has applied local patches. This behaviour is negated if it is
detected that it is operating in a git repository. To override this and update
C<patchlevel.h> when in a Git repository use this switch.
