  =head1 NAME
  
  Cwd - get pathname of current working directory
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Cwd;
      my $dir = getcwd;
  
      use Cwd 'abs_path';
      my $abs_path = abs_path($file);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides functions for determining the pathname of the
  current working directory.  It is recommended that getcwd (or another
  *cwd() function) be used in I<all> code to ensure portability.
  
  By default, it exports the functions cwd(), getcwd(), fastcwd(), and
  fastgetcwd() (and, on Win32, getdcwd()) into the caller's namespace.  
  
  
  =head2 getcwd and friends
  
  Each of these functions are called without arguments and return the
  absolute path of the current working directory.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item getcwd
  
      my $cwd = getcwd();
  
  Returns the current working directory.
  
  Exposes the POSIX function getcwd(3) or re-implements it if it's not
  available.
  
  =item cwd
  
      my $cwd = cwd();
  
  The cwd() is the most natural form for the current architecture.  For
  most systems it is identical to `pwd` (but without the trailing line
  terminator).
  
  =item fastcwd
  
      my $cwd = fastcwd();
  
  A more dangerous version of getcwd(), but potentially faster.
  
  It might conceivably chdir() you out of a directory that it can't
  chdir() you back into.  If fastcwd encounters a problem it will return
  undef but will probably leave you in a different directory.  For a
  measure of extra security, if everything appears to have worked, the
  fastcwd() function will check that it leaves you in the same directory
  that it started in.  If it has changed it will C<die> with the message
  "Unstable directory path, current directory changed
  unexpectedly".  That should never happen.
  
  =item fastgetcwd
  
    my $cwd = fastgetcwd();
  
  The fastgetcwd() function is provided as a synonym for cwd().
  
  =item getdcwd
  
      my $cwd = getdcwd();
      my $cwd = getdcwd('C:');
  
  The getdcwd() function is also provided on Win32 to get the current working
  directory on the specified drive, since Windows maintains a separate current
  working directory for each drive.  If no drive is specified then the current
  drive is assumed.
  
  This function simply calls the Microsoft C library _getdcwd() function.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 abs_path and friends
  
  These functions are exported only on request.  They each take a single
  argument and return the absolute pathname for it.  If no argument is
  given they'll use the current working directory.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item abs_path
  
    my $abs_path = abs_path($file);
  
  Uses the same algorithm as getcwd().  Symbolic links and relative-path
  components ("." and "..") are resolved to return the canonical
  pathname, just like realpath(3).
  
  =item realpath
  
    my $abs_path = realpath($file);
  
  A synonym for abs_path().
  
  =item fast_abs_path
  
    my $abs_path = fast_abs_path($file);
  
  A more dangerous, but potentially faster version of abs_path.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 $ENV{PWD}
  
  If you ask to override your chdir() built-in function, 
  
    use Cwd qw(chdir);
  
  then your PWD environment variable will be kept up to date.  Note that
  it will only be kept up to date if all packages which use chdir import
  it from Cwd.
  
  
  =head1 NOTES
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  Since the path separators are different on some operating systems ('/'
  on Unix, ':' on MacPerl, etc...) we recommend you use the File::Spec
  modules wherever portability is a concern.
  
  =item *
  
  Actually, on Mac OS, the C<getcwd()>, C<fastgetcwd()> and C<fastcwd()>
  functions are all aliases for the C<cwd()> function, which, on Mac OS,
  calls `pwd`.  Likewise, the C<abs_path()> function is an alias for
  C<fast_abs_path()>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  File::Spec - portably perform operations on file names
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  	use File::Spec;
  
  	$x=File::Spec->catfile('a', 'b', 'c');
  
  which returns 'a/b/c' under Unix. Or:
  
  	use File::Spec::Functions;
  
  	$x = catfile('a', 'b', 'c');
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file
  specifications (usually called "file names", but not to be confused with the
  contents of a file, or Perl's file handles), such as concatenating several
  directory and file names into a single path, or determining whether a path
  is rooted. It is based on code directly taken from MakeMaker 5.17, code
  written by Andreas KE<ouml>nig, Andy Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya
  Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.
  
  Since these functions are different for most operating systems, each set of
  OS specific routines is available in a separate module, including:
  
  	File::Spec::Unix
  	File::Spec::Mac
  	File::Spec::OS2
  	File::Spec::Win32
  	File::Spec::VMS
  
  The module appropriate for the current OS is automatically loaded by
  File::Spec. Since some modules (like VMS) make use of facilities available
  only under that OS, it may not be possible to load all modules under all
  operating systems.
  
  Since File::Spec is object oriented, subroutines should not be called directly,
  as in:
  
  	File::Spec::catfile('a','b');
  
  but rather as class methods:
  
  	File::Spec->catfile('a','b');
  
  For simple uses, L<File::Spec::Functions> provides convenient functional
  forms of these methods.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =over 2
  
  =item canonpath
  X<canonpath>
  
  No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
  path.
  
      $cpath = File::Spec->canonpath( $path ) ;
  
  Note that this does *not* collapse F<x/../y> sections into F<y>.  This
  is by design.  If F</foo> on your system is a symlink to F</bar/baz>,
  then F</foo/../quux> is actually F</bar/quux>, not F</quux> as a naive
  F<../>-removal would give you.  If you want to do this kind of
  processing, you probably want C<Cwd>'s C<realpath()> function to
  actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.
  
  =item catdir
  X<catdir>
  
  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending
  with a directory. But remove the trailing slash from the resulting
  string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and confuses
  OS/2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the
  trailing slash :-)
  
      $path = File::Spec->catdir( @directories );
  
  =item catfile
  X<catfile>
  
  Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a
  complete path ending with a filename
  
      $path = File::Spec->catfile( @directories, $filename );
  
  =item curdir
  X<curdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the current directory.
  
      $curdir = File::Spec->curdir();
  
  =item devnull
  X<devnull>
  
  Returns a string representation of the null device.
  
      $devnull = File::Spec->devnull();
  
  =item rootdir
  X<rootdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the root directory.
  
      $rootdir = File::Spec->rootdir();
  
  =item tmpdir
  X<tmpdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from a
  list of possible temporary directories.  Returns the current directory
  if no writable temporary directories are found.  The list of directories
  checked depends on the platform; e.g. File::Spec::Unix checks C<$ENV{TMPDIR}>
  (unless taint is on) and F</tmp>.
  
      $tmpdir = File::Spec->tmpdir();
  
  =item updir
  X<updir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the parent directory.
  
      $updir = File::Spec->updir();
  
  =item no_upwards
  
  Given a list of file names, strip out those that refer to a parent
  directory. (Does not strip symlinks, only '.', '..', and equivalents.)
  
      @paths = File::Spec->no_upwards( @paths );
  
  =item case_tolerant
  
  Returns a true or false value indicating, respectively, that alphabetic
  case is not or is significant when comparing file specifications.
  Cygwin and Win32 accept an optional drive argument.
  
      $is_case_tolerant = File::Spec->case_tolerant();
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as its argument a path, and returns true if it is an absolute path.
  
      $is_absolute = File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute( $path );
  
  This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2, or
  Mac OS (Classic).  It does consult the working environment for VMS
  (see L<File::Spec::VMS/file_name_is_absolute>).
  
  =item path
  X<path>
  
  Takes no argument.  Returns the environment variable C<PATH> (or the local
  platform's equivalent) as a list.
  
      @PATH = File::Spec->path();
  
  =item join
  X<join, path>
  
  join is the same as catfile.
  
  =item splitpath
  X<splitpath> X<split, path>
  
  Splits a path in to volume, directory, and filename portions. On systems
  with no concept of volume, returns '' for volume. 
  
      ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                         File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
      ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                         File::Spec->splitpath( $path, $no_file );
  
  For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, 
  assumes that the last file is a path unless C<$no_file> is true or a
  trailing separator or F</.> or F</..> is present. On Unix, this means that C<$no_file>
  true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).
  
  The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.
  
  The results can be passed to L</catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.
  
  =item splitdir
  X<splitdir> X<split, dir>
  
  The opposite of L</catdir>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  C<$directories> must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty
  directory names (C<''>) can be returned, because these are significant
  on some OSes.
  
  =item catpath()
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
  Unix, C<$volume> is ignored, and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is
  inserted if need be.  On other OSes, C<$volume> is significant.
  
      $full_path = File::Spec->catpath( $volume, $directory, $file );
  
  =item abs2rel
  X<abs2rel> X<absolute, path> X<relative, path>
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If C<$base> is not present or '', then L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd> is used. If C<$base> is
  relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
  L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
  L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems with the concept of volume, if C<$path> and C<$base> appear to be
  on two different volumes, we will not attempt to resolve the two
  paths, and we will instead simply return C<$path>.  Note that previous
  versions of this module ignored the volume of C<$base>, which resulted in
  garbage results part of the time.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  C<$base> filename as well. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If C<$path> is relative, it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
  interaction with the working environment, as logicals and
  macros are expanded.
  
  Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.
  
  =item rel2abs()
  X<rel2abs> X<absolute, path> X<relative, path>
  
  Converts a relative path to an absolute path. 
  
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path ) ;
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If C<$base> is not present or '', then L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd> is used. If C<$base> is relative,
  then it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>. This means that it
  is taken to be relative to L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems with the concept of volume, if C<$path> and C<$base> appear to be
  on two different volumes, we will not attempt to resolve the two
  paths, and we will instead simply return C<$path>.  Note that previous
  versions of this module ignored the volume of C<$base>, which resulted in
  garbage results part of the time.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  C<$base> filename as well. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If C<$path> is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using L</canonpath>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
  interaction with the working environment, as logicals and
  macros are expanded.

      $ENV{TMPDIR}
      /tmp
      $ENV{'TMP'}
      $ENV{'TEMP'}

  File::Spec::Mac - File::Spec for Mac OS (Classic)

   require File::Spec::Mac; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Methods for manipulating file specifications.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =over 2
  
  =item canonpath
  
  On Mac OS, there's nothing to be done. Returns what it's given.
  
  =cut
  
  sub canonpath {
      my ($self,$path) = @_;
      return $path;
  }
  
  =item catdir()
  
  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a path separated by colons
  (":") ending with a directory. Resulting paths are B<relative> by default,
  but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this, see below). Automatically
  puts a trailing ":" on the end of the complete path, because that's what's
  done in MacPerl's environment and helps to distinguish a file path from a
  directory path.
  
  B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the resulting
  path is relative by default and I<not> absolute. This decision was made due
  to portability reasons. Since C<File::Spec-E<gt>catdir()> returns relative paths
  on all other operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac
  OS. Note that this may break some existing scripts.
  
  The intended purpose of this routine is to concatenate I<directory names>.
  But because of the nature of Macintosh paths, some additional possibilities
  are allowed to make using this routine give reasonable results for some
  common situations. In other words, you are also allowed to concatenate
  I<paths> instead of directory names (strictly speaking, a string like ":a"
  is a path, but not a name, since it contains a punctuation character ":").
  
  So, beside calls like
  
      catdir("a") = ":a:"
      catdir("a","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir() = ""                    (special case)
  
  calls like the following
  
      catdir(":a:") = ":a:"
      catdir(":a","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":a:","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":a:",":b:") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":") = ":"
  
  are allowed.
  
  Here are the rules that are used in C<catdir()>; note that we try to be as
  compatible as possible to Unix:
  
  =over 2
  
  =item 1.
  
  The resulting path is relative by default, i.e. the resulting path will have a
  leading colon.
  
  =item 2.
  
  A trailing colon is added automatically to the resulting path, to denote a
  directory.
  
  =item 3.
  
  Generally, each argument has one leading ":" and one trailing ":"
  removed (if any). They are then joined together by a ":". Special
  treatment applies for arguments denoting updir paths like "::lib:",
  see (4), or arguments consisting solely of colons ("colon paths"),
  see (5).
  
  =item 4.
  
  When an updir path like ":::lib::" is passed as argument, the number
  of directories to climb up is handled correctly, not removing leading
  or trailing colons when necessary. E.g.
  
      catdir(":::a","::b","c")    = ":::a::b:c:"
      catdir(":::a::","::b","c")  = ":::a:::b:c:"
  
  =item 5.
  
  Adding a colon ":" or empty string "" to a path at I<any> position
  doesn't alter the path, i.e. these arguments are ignored. (When a ""
  is passed as the first argument, it has a special meaning, see
  (6)). This way, a colon ":" is handled like a "." (curdir) on Unix,
  while an empty string "" is generally ignored (see
  C<Unix-E<gt>canonpath()> ). Likewise, a "::" is handled like a ".."
  (updir), and a ":::" is handled like a "../.." etc.  E.g.
  
      catdir("a",":",":","b")   = ":a:b:"
      catdir("a",":","::",":b") = ":a::b:"
  
  =item 6.
  
  If the first argument is an empty string "" or is a volume name, i.e. matches
  the pattern /^[^:]+:/, the resulting path is B<absolute>.
  
  =item 7.
  
  Passing an empty string "" as the first argument to C<catdir()> is
  like passingC<File::Spec-E<gt>rootdir()> as the first argument, i.e.
  
      catdir("","a","b")          is the same as
  
      catdir(rootdir(),"a","b").
  
  This is true on Unix, where C<catdir("","a","b")> yields "/a/b" and
  C<rootdir()> is "/". Note that C<rootdir()> on Mac OS is the startup
  volume, which is the closest in concept to Unix' "/". This should help
  to run existing scripts originally written for Unix.
  
  =item 8.
  
  For absolute paths, some cleanup is done, to ensure that the volume
  name isn't immediately followed by updirs. This is invalid, because
  this would go beyond "root". Generally, these cases are handled like
  their Unix counterparts:
  
   Unix:
      Unix->catdir("","")                 =  "/"
      Unix->catdir("",".")                =  "/"
      Unix->catdir("","..")               =  "/"        # can't go
                                                        # beyond root
      Unix->catdir("",".","..","..","a")  =  "/a"
   Mac:
      Mac->catdir("","")                  =  rootdir()  # (e.g. "HD:")
      Mac->catdir("",":")                 =  rootdir()
      Mac->catdir("","::")                =  rootdir()  # can't go
                                                        # beyond root
      Mac->catdir("",":","::","::","a")   =  rootdir() . "a:"
                                                      # (e.g. "HD:a:")
  
  However, this approach is limited to the first arguments following
  "root" (again, see C<Unix-E<gt>canonpath()> ). If there are more
  arguments that move up the directory tree, an invalid path going
  beyond root can be created.
  
  =back
  
  As you've seen, you can force C<catdir()> to create an absolute path
  by passing either an empty string or a path that begins with a volume
  name as the first argument. However, you are strongly encouraged not
  to do so, since this is done only for backward compatibility. Newer
  versions of File::Spec come with a method called C<catpath()> (see
  below), that is designed to offer a portable solution for the creation
  of absolute paths.  It takes volume, directory and file portions and
  returns an entire path. While C<catdir()> is still suitable for the
  concatenation of I<directory names>, you are encouraged to use
  C<catpath()> to concatenate I<volume names> and I<directory
  paths>. E.g.
  
      $dir      = File::Spec->catdir("tmp","sources");
      $abs_path = File::Spec->catpath("MacintoshHD:", $dir,"");
  
  yields
  
      "MacintoshHD:tmp:sources:" .

  					$updir_count += (length($arg) - 1);
  				}
  				$arg = (':' x $updir_count);
  			} else {
  				$arg =~ s/^://s; # remove a leading ':' if any
  				$arg = "$arg:" unless ($arg =~ /:\Z(?!\n)/); # ensure trailing ':'
  			}
  			$result .= $arg;
  		}#unless
  	}
  
  	if ( ($relative) && ($result !~ /^:/) ) {

  	}

  }
  
  =item catfile
  
  Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a
  complete path ending with a filename. Resulting paths are B<relative>
  by default, but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this).
  
  B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the
  resulting path is relative by default and I<not> absolute. This
  decision was made due to portability reasons. Since
  C<File::Spec-E<gt>catfile()> returns relative paths on all other
  operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac OS.
  Note that this may break some existing scripts.
  
  The last argument is always considered to be the file portion. Since
  C<catfile()> uses C<catdir()> (see above) for the concatenation of the
  directory portions (if any), the following with regard to relative and
  absolute paths is true:
  
      catfile("")     = ""
      catfile("file") = "file"
  
  but
  
      catfile("","")        = rootdir()         # (e.g. "HD:")
      catfile("","file")    = rootdir() . file  # (e.g. "HD:file")
      catfile("HD:","file") = "HD:file"
  
  This means that C<catdir()> is called only when there are two or more
  arguments, as one might expect.
  
  Note that the leading ":" is removed from the filename, so that
  
      catfile("a","b","file")  = ":a:b:file"    and
  
      catfile("a","b",":file") = ":a:b:file"
  
  give the same answer.
  
  To concatenate I<volume names>, I<directory paths> and I<filenames>,
  you are encouraged to use C<catpath()> (see below).
  
  =cut
  
  sub catfile {
      my $self = shift;
      return '' unless @_;
      my $file = pop @_;
      return $file unless @_;
      my $dir = $self->catdir(@_);
      $file =~ s/^://s;
      return $dir.$file;
  }
  
  =item curdir
  
  Returns a string representing the current directory. On Mac OS, this is ":".
  
  =cut
  
  sub curdir {
      return ":";
  }
  
  =item devnull
  
  Returns a string representing the null device. On Mac OS, this is "Dev:Null".
  
  =cut
  
  sub devnull {
      return "Dev:Null";
  }
  
  =item rootdir
  
  Returns a string representing the root directory.  Under MacPerl,
  returns the name of the startup volume, since that's the closest in
  concept, although other volumes aren't rooted there. The name has a
  trailing ":", because that's the correct specification for a volume
  name on Mac OS.
  
  If Mac::Files could not be loaded, the empty string is returned.
  
  =cut
  
  sub rootdir {
  #
  #  There's no real root directory on Mac OS. The name of the startup
  #  volume is returned, since that's the closest in concept.
  #
      return '' unless $macfiles;
      my $system = Mac::Files::FindFolder(&Mac::Files::kOnSystemDisk,
  	&Mac::Files::kSystemFolderType);
      $system =~ s/:.*\Z(?!\n)/:/s;
      return $system;
  }
  
  =item tmpdir
  
  Returns the contents of $ENV{TMPDIR}, if that directory exits or the
  current working directory otherwise. Under MacPerl, $ENV{TMPDIR} will
  contain a path like "MacintoshHD:Temporary Items:", which is a hidden
  directory on your startup volume.
  
  =cut
  
  my $tmpdir;
  sub tmpdir {
      return $tmpdir if defined $tmpdir;
      $tmpdir = $_[0]->_tmpdir( $ENV{TMPDIR} );
  }
  
  =item updir
  
  Returns a string representing the parent directory. On Mac OS, this is "::".
  
  =cut
  
  sub updir {
      return "::";
  }
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as argument a path and returns true, if it is an absolute path.
  If the path has a leading ":", it's a relative path. Otherwise, it's an
  absolute path, unless the path doesn't contain any colons, i.e. it's a name
  like "a". In this particular case, the path is considered to be relative
  (i.e. it is considered to be a filename). Use ":" in the appropriate place
  in the path if you want to distinguish unambiguously. As a special case,
  the filename '' is always considered to be absolute. Note that with version
  1.2 of File::Spec::Mac, this does no longer consult the local filesystem.
  
  E.g.
  
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("a");         # false (relative)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute(":a:b:");     # false (relative)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("MacintoshHD:");
                                                      # true (absolute)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("");          # true (absolute)
  
  
  =cut
  
  sub file_name_is_absolute {
      my ($self,$file) = @_;
      if ($file =~ /:/) {
  	return (! ($file =~ m/^:/s) );
      } elsif ( $file eq '' ) {
          return 1 ;
      } else {
  	return 0; # i.e. a file like "a"
      }
  }
  
  =item path
  
  Returns the null list for the MacPerl application, since the concept is
  usually meaningless under Mac OS. But if you're using the MacPerl tool under
  MPW, it gives back $ENV{Commands} suitably split, as is done in
  :lib:ExtUtils:MM_Mac.pm.
  
  =cut
  
  sub path {
  #
  #  The concept is meaningless under the MacPerl application.
  #  Under MPW, it has a meaning.
  #
      return unless exists $ENV{Commands};
      return split(/,/, $ENV{Commands});
  }
  
  =item splitpath
  
      ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
      ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path,
                                                            $no_file );
  
  Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions.
  
  On Mac OS, assumes that the last part of the path is a filename unless
  $no_file is true or a trailing separator ":" is present.
  
  The volume portion is always returned with a trailing ":". The directory portion
  is always returned with a leading (to denote a relative path) and a trailing ":"
  (to denote a directory). The file portion is always returned I<without> a leading ":".
  Empty portions are returned as empty string ''.
  
  The results can be passed to C<catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.

  =item splitdir
  
  The opposite of C<catdir()>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  $directories should be only the directory portion of the path on systems
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories. Consider using C<splitpath()> otherwise.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty directory names
  (C<"">) can be returned. Since C<catdir()> on Mac OS always appends a trailing
  colon to distinguish a directory path from a file path, a single trailing colon
  will be ignored, i.e. there's no empty directory name after it.
  
  Hence, on Mac OS, both
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c:" );    and
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c" );
  
  yield:
  
      ( "a", "b", "::", "c")
  
  while
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c::" );
  
  yields:
  
      ( "a", "b", "::", "c", "::")

  =item catpath
  
      $path = File::Spec->catpath($volume,$directory,$file);
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. On Mac OS,
  $volume, $directory and $file are concatenated.  A ':' is inserted if need be. You
  may pass an empty string for each portion. If all portions are empty, the empty
  string is returned. If $volume is empty, the result will be a relative path,
  beginning with a ':'. If $volume and $directory are empty, a leading ":" (if any)
  is removed form $file and the remainder is returned. If $file is empty, the
  resulting path will have a trailing ':'.

  =item abs2rel
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path and returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  Note that both paths are assumed to have a notation that distinguishes a
  directory path (with trailing ':') from a file path (without trailing ':').
  
  If $base is not present or '', then the current working directory is used.
  If $base is relative, then it is converted to absolute form using C<rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to the current working directory.
  
  If $path and $base appear to be on two different volumes, we will not
  attempt to resolve the two paths, and we will instead simply return
  $path.  Note that previous versions of this module ignored the volume
  of $base, which resulted in garbage results part of the time.
  
  If $base doesn't have a trailing colon, the last element of $base is
  assumed to be a filename.  This filename is ignored.  Otherwise all path
  components are assumed to be directories.
  
  If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using C<rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to the current working directory.
  
  Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.

  Converts a relative path to an absolute path:

  Note that both paths are assumed to have a notation that distinguishes a
  directory path (with trailing ':') from a file path (without trailing ':').
  
  If $base is not present or '', then $base is set to the current working
  directory. If $base is relative, then it is converted to absolute form
  using C<rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to the
  current working directory.
  
  If $base doesn't have a trailing colon, the last element of $base is
  assumed to be a filename.  This filename is ignored.  Otherwise all path
  components are assumed to be directories.
  
  If $path is already absolute, it is returned and $base is ignored.

=head1 NAME

patchperl - patch a perl source tree

=head1 VERSION

version 2.08

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  patchperl

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=over

=item C<--version>

Prints the version of L<Devel::PatchPerl> to STDOUT and exits

=item C<--patchlevel>

Devel::PatchPerl will normally update the C<patchlevel.h> file in the perl source tree
to indicate that it has applied local patches. This behaviour is negated if it is
detected that it is operating in a git repository. To override this and update
C<patchlevel.h> when in a Git repository use this switch.
